## Thakker Light Sky Theme (High Contrast)

This theme is inspired by one of the most common ways that we read--dark text on a light background. Newspapers and books are both made the same way, but not most color themes.

The Light Sky Theme strikes a balance between a warm, beige background contrasted with colder, darker foreground colors for more readable syntax highlighting. 

The Light Sky Theme is dedicated to my friend of the same name (Sky).

Screenshots coming soon. Tested with JavaScript and TypeScript.
