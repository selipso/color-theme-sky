## Thakker Light Sky Theme (High Contrast)

This theme is inspired by one of the most common ways that we read and have been reading for thousands of years--dark text on a light background. Newspapers and books are both made the same way, but not most color themes because the contrast level for light themes is often a bit off.

The Light Sky Theme strikes a balance between a warm, beige background contrasted with colder, darker foreground colors for more readable syntax highlighting.

This theme is dedicated to my friend of the same name (Sky).
